Building Interactive Spaces requires the following dependencies:

The Android SDK

The RXTX Java serial communications library.
from http://rxtx.qbang.org

The Bluecove Bluetooth Library
from http://bluecove.org/

Jython
from http://jython.org/

JSR-80
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/javax-usb/

usb4java
from http://kayahr.github.io/usb4java/

Create a file in the root folder of the Interactive Spaces project called
gradle.properties.

This file should contain the following properties. Each of the properties
ending in .home say where you have a package installed. The examples
below give a fake place where each software package is installed, you will
change these to match where you installed the particular packages.

android.sdk.home = /home/you/software/android/android-sdk-linux_86
rxtx.home = /usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar
bluecove.home = /home/you/software/bluecove/bluecove-2.1.0.jar
jython.home = /home/you/software/jython/jython2.5.2
jsr80.home = /home/you/software/jsr80/jsr80-1.0.0.jar
usb4java.home = /home/you/software/usb4java/usb4java-1.0.0.jar

The Android controller is built for a given minimum version of Android.
The following example shows building the Android controller for Ice Cream
Sandwich.

android.platform = android-16

Install ROS on your computer. Install from www.ros.org. I usually install the
desktop full version, though there may be a smaller version that will work.

Place your interactivespaces repository on the ROS package path.
