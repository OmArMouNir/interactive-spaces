Building Interactive Spaces requires the following dependencies:

The Android SDK
The RXTX Java serial communications library.
The Bluecove Bluetooth Library
Jython

Create a file in the root folder of the Interactive Spaces project called
gradle.properties.

This file should contain the following properties. Each of the properties
ending in .home say where you have a package installed. The examples
below give a fake place where each software package is installed, you will
change these to match where you installed the particular packages.

android.sdk.home = /home/you/software/android/android-sdk-linux_86
rxtx.home = /usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar
bluecove.home = /home/you/software/bluecove/bluecove-2.1.0.jar
jython.home = /home/you/software/jython/jython2.5.2

The Android controller is built for a given minimum version of Android.
The following example shows building the Androind controller for Ice Cream
Sandwich.

android.platform = android-16
